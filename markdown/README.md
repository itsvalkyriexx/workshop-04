# Workshop 4

By: Tala Said

## Emphasis

The sun dipped below the horizon, *painting the sky in hues of orange*, pink, and purple. The gentle breeze carried the scent of blooming flowers, creating a serene atmosphere. Birds chirped their evening songs, signaling the end of another day. As the world transitioned from day to night, *the first stars began to twinkle*, offering a glimpse of the vast universe above. It was a moment of quiet reflection, a reminder of nature's timeless beauty and the simple joys it brings.

## Strong

In the distance, **the faint hum of a bustling city could be heard**, a stark contrast to the tranquility of the countryside. Skyscrapers stood tall, their windows glowing like tiny lanterns, while streets buzzed with life. People hurried along sidewalks, each with their own story, their own destination. Amid the chaos, there was a sense of connection, a shared human experience. Whether in the stillness of nature or the vibrancy of urban life, there was beauty to be found in every corner of the world.
